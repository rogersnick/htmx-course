# *HTMX Fundamentals Through Fun & Interactive Projects*

This is an easily accessible HTMX + AI course that showcases server-driven web development techniques. I'll walk through three mini projects (plus significant enhancements to each) to teach and demonstrate the most important parts of HTMX.

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course.git
 ```

## Foundations Tutorials

If you are new to htmx, start with the Foundations series of tutorials to get your development environment set up, and start slinging some code. We learn by doing here.

- [1. Introduction to HTMX](https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course/blob/main/tutorials/1_foundations/1.md) - When and why would you use HTMX?
- [2. Setting Up the Environment](https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course/blob/main/tutorials/1_foundations/2.md) - The development environment for these projects is intentionally minimal, but you'll need to set a couple things up.
- [3. HTMX Core Attributes & How They Work](https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course/blob/main/tutorials/1_foundations/3.md) - Learn the basic attributes like `hx-get` and `hx-post` and get started with example code.
- [4. Forms, Inputs & Dynamic Content](https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course/blob/main/tutorials/1_foundations/4.md) - The web is full of forms. Build a contact form, and experiment with some advanced htmx via keyup triggers.
- [5. Enhancing User Experience with HTMX](https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course/blob/main/tutorials/1_foundations/5.md) - Learn to add interactivity with loading indicators, confirmation dialogs, and real-time polling.

## Mini-Projects

These projects aim to be:

- ✅ Unique & Fun – Not another boring CRUD app.
- ✅ Highly Interactive – Makes HTMX shine with real-time updates & dynamic interactions.
- ✅ Beginner-Friendly – Teaches core HTMX features in an exciting way.

 These projects showcase modern, minimal web development techniques, focusing on the server-driven UI model. The starter projects are located in the `htmx-course-mvps` folder. You can start each of them like this:

 ```bash
cd htmx-course-mvps/flashcard-battle
npm install
npm start
 ```

# *HTMX Fundamentals Through Fun & Interactive Projects*

This is an easily accessible HTMX + AI course that showcases modern web development techniques, focusing on the server-driven UI model. I'll walk through three mini projects (plus significant enhancements to each) to teach and demonstrate these concepts.

This course is:

- ✅ Unique & Fun – Not another boring CRUD app.
- ✅ Highly Interactive – Makes HTMX shine with real-time updates & dynamic interactions.
- ✅ Beginner-Friendly – Teaches core HTMX features in an exciting way.

## Mini-Projects

 These projects showcase modern, minimal web development techniques, focusing on the server-driven UI model. You can find starter points in the `htmx-course-mvps` folder.

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/rogersnick/htmx-course.git
 ```

 Each mini project is a node project. You can get started with:
 ```bash
npm install && npm start
 ```

Each mini-project comes with an MVP (Minimum Viable Project) that teaches HTMX fundamentals. The three projects are:

## Flash Card Battler

- Form handling
- Score tracking per user
- Generating questions with AI

## Hackathon Ideas Generator

- Idea Generation by Category
- Advanced Triggers, Instant feedback to user input
- Real-time updates with polling or websockets

## Community Story Builder

- Collaborative input
- Concurrency (multiple submissions at once)
- Complex persistent data structures

### **Checkpoint 1: When would you use HTMX instead of a heavy SPA framework?**  
I’d lean toward HTMX in situations where I only need **selective interactivity** on a predominantly server-rendered app, rather than building a full-scale front-end in React/Vue/Angular. For example, in a legacy **Rails** or **Django** project, adding small dynamic components—like inline edits, toggling content, or partial updates—would be much simpler with HTMX than introducing an entire MVC or MVVM framework. That way, I avoid the overhead of a separate build process, a JavaScript bundler, and a client-side router just for a few interactive elements.

*Concrete scenario:*  
\- In a past project, I needed to show a **live “recent comments”** section on a blog post without reloading the page. Instead of rewriting the whole front-end with React, I could have used HTMX to periodically fetch new comments and insert them into the DOM. This would have kept my existing server-side templates intact while still delivering a real-time feel.

### **Checkpoint 2: What excites you about HTMX?**  
I’m most excited about its **simplicity** and how easily it handles **form submissions** and partial page updates **without** needing a heavy front-end framework. I love how HTMX allows me to keep my **server-side rendering** logic while still offering a smoother user experience—particularly with features like:

1. **Dynamic Form Handling**: Submitting forms via `hx-post` and receiving partial HTML responses instantly.  
2. **Real-Time Updates/Live Feeds**: Using `hx-trigger="every 5s"` (polling) or even hooking into websockets for collaborative apps.  
3. **Reduced Complexity**: No separate build pipeline or component library is required; just drop in the `<script>` tag and start using `hx-*` attributes.

The feature I want to explore first is **inline form validation** (e.g., checking username availability or validating fields on-the-fly). It’s a great entry point for seeing how HTMX can replace a lot of custom JavaScript with simple HTML attributes.

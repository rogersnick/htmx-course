# Chapter 2: Setting Up the Environment

In this chapter, we’ll walk through installing Node.js (or confirming you already have it), creating a simple Express.js server, and organizing a basic file structure ready to take advantage of HTMX. We’ll also cover how to use a template engine like **EJS** so we can return partial HTML snippets easily. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a solid foundation that you can reuse for all your HTMX projects.

## 2.1 Installing Node.js

If you haven’t already installed Node.js, here are a few approaches:

1. **Official Installer**  
   - Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts.

2. **Node Version Manager (NVM)**  
   - For macOS or Linux, you can install **NVM** from its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).  
   - Once installed, use `nvm install --lts` to install the latest LTS version of Node.
   - With NVM, you can easily switch between Node versions if needed.

3. **Package Managers**  
   - On some Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.), you can install Node.js via `apt`, `dnf`, or another package manager.  
   - However, these versions can sometimes be outdated. Ensure you’re on at least Node 14+ for best results.

### Verifying Node.js Installation

After installation, check your versions:

```bash
node -v
# e.g., v20.10.0

npm -v
# e.g., 10.2.3
```

If you see version numbers, you’re good to go. If you prefer Yarn or PNPM, feel free to use those for package management.

## 2.2 Creating a New Project Directory

Let’s create a new folder for our HTMX experiments. You can name this folder anything—here, we’ll call it `htmx-projects`.

```bash
mkdir htmx-projects
cd htmx-projects
```

Initialize an empty Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command creates a `package.json` file with default settings. We’ll edit it as we go.

---

## 2.3 Installing Express.js

We’ll use Express.js to quickly spin up a server. Install it via npm:

```bash
npm install express
```

Optionally, you might also install **nodemon**, which automatically restarts your server whenever you change files:

```bash
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

With nodemon, you can run your server in development mode like this:

```bash
npx nodemon index.js
```

(We’ll see how to set this up in a script shortly.)

---

## 2.4 Setting Up a Basic Express Server

Let’s create a file named `index.js` in the root of `htmx-projects`. This will be our primary server file.

```js
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware to serve static files from "public" folder
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// A simple route for testing
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express + HTMX!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Running the Server

1. **Without nodemon**:  
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
   Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

2. **With nodemon** (recommended for development):  
   ```bash
   npx nodemon index.js
   ```
   This automatically restarts the server when files change.

You should see the message **“Hello from Express + HTMX!”** in your browser.

## 2.5 Organizing Your File Structure

For larger HTMX projects, it’s good to plan a basic structure:

```
htmx-projects/
 ┣ index.js
 ┣ package.json
 ┣ /public
 ┃ ┗ /css
 ┃   ┗ styles.css
 ┃ ┗ /js
 ┃   ┗ main.js
 ┣ /views
 ┃ ┣ layout.ejs
 ┃ ┗ index.ejs
 ┗ /routes
   ┗ main.js
```

- **`index.js`**: Main server entry point.  
- **`/public`**: Contains static assets (CSS, images, client-side JS).  
- **`/views`**: Template files for server-rendered HTML (if you use EJS, Pug, or Handlebars).  
- **`/routes`**: Separate route definitions or controllers to keep logic organized.

Of course, this structure is flexible. Adjust it to your preferences or framework conventions.

---

## 2.6 Choosing and Configuring a Template Engine

### 2.6.1 Why Use a Template Engine?

HTMX relies on partial HTML snippets returned by the server. Using a template engine can make these snippets reusable and dynamic. For example, you might have a partial template to display a single “flashcard” in the upcoming **Flashcard Battle** project.

### 2.6.2 Installing EJS

We’ll use **EJS** as an example. Install it:

```bash
npm install ejs
```

Then configure Express to use EJS in `index.js`:

```js
// index.js
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Set the view engine to EJS
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// If needed, set a custom "views" directory path
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));

// Serve static files from "public"
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// A simple route to render an EJS template
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { message: 'Hello from EJS + HTMX!' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### 2.6.3 Creating a Basic `index.ejs` Template

Inside your `views/` folder, create `index.ejs`:

```html
<!-- views/index.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTMX + EJS</title>
    <!-- Typically, you'd include a CSS file in the head as well -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><%= message %></h1>

    <!-- This is where we'll eventually load HTMX -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.2"></script>
    <!-- Optionally, you can place htmx.js in your public/js folder and serve it locally -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Now if you visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), you should see your “Hello from EJS + HTMX!” message rendered through the template.

---

## 2.7 Integrating HTMX into Your Setup

At this point, we have a working Express app with a template engine. To integrate HTMX, we just need to ensure we include the HTMX script:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can **download** the minified HTMX script from [https://htmx.org/](https://htmx.org/) and place it in your `public/js` directory, then reference it locally:

```html
<script src="/js/htmx.min.js"></script>
```

### 2.7.1 Testing an `hx-get` Example

Let’s see if everything is working. Modify our EJS template to include a basic button that fetches new content:

```html
<!-- views/index.ejs -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTMX + EJS</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>HTMX Test</h1>

    <!-- 
      hx-get="/random-message"
      - On click, it will make a GET request to /random-message

      hx-target="#message-area"
      - The response replaces the content inside the element with id="message-area"

      hx-swap="innerHTML"
      - We'll swap just the inner HTML of the target
    -->
    <button 
      hx-get="/random-message" 
      hx-target="#message-area"
      hx-swap="innerHTML">
      Fetch Random Message
    </button>

    <div id="message-area">
      <!-- The response from /random-message will replace this content -->
      Click the button to load a random message.
    </div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.2"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Next, create a new route for `GET /random-message` in `index.js` (or in a dedicated `routes/main.js` if you prefer):

```js
// index.js
app.get('/random-message', (req, res) => {
  const messages = [
    'Hello from the server!',
    'This is a random message.',
    'HTMX is awesome!',
    'Server-driven UIs rock!'
  ];
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length);
  const randomMsg = messages[randomIndex];

  // Send back a tiny snippet of HTML
  res.send(`<p>${randomMsg}</p>`);
});
```

Now, when you click **“Fetch Random Message”**, HTMX sends an AJAX request to `/random-message`, receives a snippet (`<p>Random Message</p>`), and injects it into the `#message-area` div—no page reload needed!

## 2.8 Tips for a Smooth Development Experience

### 1. Use **nodemon** or Similar Tools
Having to restart your server manually can slow you down. In your `package.json`, add a “dev” script:

```json
{
  "name": "htmx-projects",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.x",
    "ejs": "^3.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.x"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Keep Routes Organized
As your project grows, create a `/routes` folder with different files for different features. For example:

- `routes/flashcards.js`
- `routes/ideas.js`
- `routes/story.js`

Then in your `index.js`, you can do something like:

```js
const flashcardsRouter = require('./routes/flashcards');
app.use('/flashcards', flashcardsRouter);
```

### 3. Use a **`views/partials`** Folder for HTMX Snippets
If you plan to send small partials (like a single flashcard or a snippet of HTML) in response to HTMX requests, store them in a dedicated folder:

```
views/
 ┣ partials/
 ┃ ┗ flashcard.ejs
 ┗ index.ejs
```

This way, your main templates don’t get cluttered with smaller snippet templates.

### 4. Consider Security & Data Handling Early
Even though this is a simple setup, keep best practices in mind:
- Parse JSON or form data securely (Express has built-in body parsing if you need it).  
- Handle user input carefully. If user-generated content will be inserted into HTML, consider sanitizing it to prevent XSS attacks.

### 5. Plan for **Production** vs. **Development**  
- Use environment variables (e.g., `.env` files) for secrets like database credentials.  
- Consider setting up a process manager like **PM2** for production deployments.

## 2.9 Summary

You’ve now installed Node.js, set up a basic Express server, organized your files, and integrated EJS for server-rendered templates. We also tested HTMX with a simple `hx-get` example to confirm everything is wired correctly. 

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Minimal Setup**: With just a few steps, you can serve dynamic pages and partials.  
2. **File Structure**: A clear structure (e.g., `views`, `public`, `routes`) keeps your project maintainable.  
3. **Templating**: EJS makes it easy to return small snippets of HTML, which is perfect for HTMX-based interactions.  
4. **HTMX Integration**: Adding the `<script>` tag for HTMX is all you need to start using its attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-post`, etc.).

In the next chapter, we’ll dive deeper into **HTMX core attributes** and see how they work in practice, including how to handle data submission (`hx-post`), targeting specific elements on the page, and working with response snippets. Let’s keep building!
